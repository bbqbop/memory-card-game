# Dino Memory Game

The Dino Memory Game is a simple memory game. It is built as a practice project using React hooks. 
It challenges players to test and improve their memory skills by clicking dinosaur icons without repeating the same one.

## Game Rules

- A grid of dinosaur icons is displayed on the screen.
- The objective is to click on each icon without repeating any previously clicked icon.
- If all displayed icons have been clicked, the player can advance to the next level, where a new and larger dino-selection is being displayed.
- If a player clicks on a previously clicked icon, the game ends.
- The score is displayed, and if it is higher than the previous high score, it is updated.
- Players can restart the game at any time to try again.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Hooks: Allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- HTML5: The markup language used for structuring the game's UI.
- CSS3: The styling language used for visual presentation and animations.
